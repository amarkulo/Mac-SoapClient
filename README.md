#Mac-SoapClient

SOAP Client is a really handy tool when working with SOAP APIs on OSX. It was originally available for download at…

http://ditchnet.org/soapclient/

Which is great, but you still have to build it yourself. So, I've built it and included it in this repository. You can download the app file here:
